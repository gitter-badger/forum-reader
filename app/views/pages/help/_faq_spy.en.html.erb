For example you have got a letter named "Favorite Blogs" in which
feeds of all blogs I read among which is bbc are gathered. The
delivery is set on Friday 8pm. But sometimes you don’t want to wait
for Friday and want to read it right now.

<br/><br/>
In this case give to the bot following commands:
<br/><br/>

<b>bbc</b> - to show news of the feed with the word bbc in it’s name;<br/>
<b>blogs</b> - to show the latest news from all feeds of a letter.

<br/><br/>

After this the news are supposed as read by you and they are
<b>not</b> going to be included in Friday’s letter.
